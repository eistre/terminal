# Linux Terminal Exercise Environment

### Master's Thesis Project

This project is a continuation of two Bachelor's thesis projects:

1. **Initial Proof of Concept (POC)** by Joonas Halapuu
   ([Bachelor's thesis project](https://gitlab.com/JoonasHalapuu/ubuntuterminal)) - The foundational POC that
   demonstrated the feasibility of the concept.

2. **Working Application Development** - Building upon the POC, the second Bachelor's thesis transformed it into a fully
   functional application that has been successfully deployed and used in university courses.

## About

environment. Admin users have the ability to modify, create, and delete tasks.
